# Uber-Ride-Insights---Navigating-Mobility-Data-Analysis-
This project is an SQL-based assignment focused on analyzing a dataset of ride-sharing operations, encompassing passenger, driver, and individual ride details. The goal is to leverage SQL to extract meaningful mobility insights, identify performance trends, evaluate driver and passenger metrics, and understand the economics of the ride-sharing service.

The analysis is designed to mimic a data intelligence role, providing data-driven answers to operational and strategic questions.
